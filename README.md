# UIDesign


This the the UI design as asked for.I tried my best to match the UI provided to me
Following are some assumptions/constraints :-

1. Colours and styles may be a little different as expected 
2. All the customizations that were needed  may be a little different from the screenshot.
3. Images were cropped from the original screenshot so their and quality and size are not perfect.
4. Images for bottom navigation bar and actionbar icons were taken from image assets provided in Android studio.
5. The UI has been tested for Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro
